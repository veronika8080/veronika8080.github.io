      <h4>It was amazing...</h4>
      <p>When I came to the gym I was surprised of the size.It was extremely huge and beautiful.Another point which also surprised me was the presence of boys.If to be honest I was shy at first,but then I saw that guys are very friendly and I relaxed.Since I haven’t been playing football professionally never before some experiences were difficult but overall training was awesome.We were running,kicking and thinking a lot.At that moment I realized that football is not only about physical activity but also about mental.So,both my brain and legs were functioning.</p>
				 <h2>First match</h2>

      <h4>I was so nervous...</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH7du8wNbzM"target="_blank">First match</a>When I was our first enemies I was shocked.They all were at the age from 25 to 35.They all were really big and confident,while we were like chickens afraid of every their movement.So,it is easily understood that we lost.However,after the first part we realized that there is nothing scary in them and become more confident and even scored one goal.Unfortunately,they had more experience in comparisons,so they defeated us.It was sad but we figured out all our mistakes and then happen that.</p>
				<h2>My feelings</h2>

      <h4>BOOM..</h4>
      <p>As I already mentioned before I haven’t been playing football before LCC,however I felt no pressure and no shame for my failures.I mean it was so pleasant that every member from both men and women teams was so friendly and always ready to help.I felt as if we are a one huge family.</p>
