    <h2>How I found out about football?</h2>
    <p>Finally, when I have been studying at LCC for two weeks, I saw the story on Instagram that there was a women football section and I missed it. I was so excited that LCC wants to create a women’football team. Following this I met a girl who visited that section and started to ask millions of questions and since she couldn’t answer all of them at once, she offered me to go to the coach office and ask him. I immediately ran into his office and met a men’ football team manager.She answered all my questions and invited me to the first training.I didn’t have any additional thoughts at that moment. I was thinking only about “I want to be a member of this team”.So,it was the beginning.</p>
